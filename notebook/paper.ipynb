    "_**Abstract.** Nowadays, stochastic gradient algorithms have become one of the most popular numerical optimization methods due to their efficiency and formulation simplicity. They are used in a variety of areas: from cost reduction problems to deep learning. The common feature of all these problems is to find the optimal values for a set of independent parameters in a mathematical model that can be described by a set of equalities and inequalities. The number of computing resources and time spent to solve the problem, the accuracy of the mathematical model, etc. depends on how effective the chosen gradient descent algorithm is. In practice, stochastic gradient algorithms only show fair results for convex and smooth functions. However, most modern optimization problems do not belong to these classes (for instance, a deep neural network with a ReLU activation function is a non-smooth optimization problem). The article proposes a new modification to the existing stochastic gradient algorithms based on an averaged functions smoothing technique and finite-difference approximations with more robustness to the non-smooth target functions._\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most modern stochastic gradient algorithms have significant problems optimizing functions with multiple minima because they are more likely to converge to the local minimum than the global one. Therefore, the research of adaptive stochastic gradient methods on applied non-convex and multi-extreme optimization problems is relevant, which also considers improving existing optimization methods and proposing modifications. The second problem in applying stochastic gradient methods is the possible functions' non-smoothness and the limitations in the optimization problem. Constrained problems can be reduced to unconditional optimization problems with precise penalty functions, but the problem becomes non-smooth. Gradient methods in non-smooth optimization problems demonstrate a slow convergence rate and low robustness to the local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary goal of the research is to study the outcomes of replacing stochastic gradients in adaptive gradient methods with their central finite-difference alternatives and other finite-difference approximations of increased order of the local truncation error and accumulated error. To some extent, the finite-difference approximations of the gradients smooth the problem and, therefore, even out the shallow local extremes and reduce the problem's convexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted experimental studies on classical and adaptive gradient methods to confirm the theoretical conclusions. Studies are based on performed gradient substitutions for finite-difference estimates to avoid \"backpropagation\" when calculating gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the general definition of the optimization problem, we consider it as a smooth problem of stochastic programming (1) [1], which we express in the following equation:\n",

A well-known method for estimating the function $ f $ is modeling by the Monte Carlo method or any other stochastic method with a predetermined number of experiments, where $ \\xi $ is a random variable in the mathematical functional model $ \\tilde{F}(x, \\xi_i) $ and the formula for the gradient $ \\nabla \\tilde{F}(x, \\xi_i) $.\n",

The iteration scheme of gradient descent methods consists of successive updating of independent parameters of the model $ \\theta_{i} $ by the value of the anti-gradient with a certain constant step $ \\lambda \\in [0, 1] $: $ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_{i} - \\lambda \\cdot \\nabla F $.\n",

It allows us to calculate the gradient value of the stochastic oracle even if it is a non-smooth or a non-convex function. Now the surface integral of a Lipschitz continuity $ F(\\cdot) $ does not guarantee an analytical form of the equation. However, we can get an approximate value of this integral using the Monte-Carlo algorithm. Suppose we define a set of $ K $ uniformly distributed stochastic vectors $ \\tilde{y} $ on an single sphere $ S_{1}(0) = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: || y || = 1 \\} $.

Thus the gradient value of a smoothed function, which also describes the rate of change, will be also constrained by the Lipschitz constant, we showed in the expression (23). Based on the generalization (16)-(23), we make algorithms for a stochastic optimization problem robust to the non-smooth and non-convex functions theoretically, which is the key benefit of a proposed research."
